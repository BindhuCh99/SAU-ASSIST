Official Transcripts
Southern Arkansas University uses the Parchment credentials service to receive and process official transcript orders online. Please use the blue button below to begin your Parchment order:

Order an official transcript
The Parchment site will provide instructions for placing your order, including delivery options and fees. You can order as many transcripts as you like in a single session. Parchment charges a $3.50 processing fee for each transcript sent, plus an additional postage charge for physical mailed transcripts. Order updates will be emailed to you, and you can also check your order status and history online. You can order transcripts at any time of the day or week, and the Registrar’s Office will process transcript orders during business hours. Order processing times may vary due to the number of orders received daily, so please be sure to place your request at least two to four weeks prior to the deadline when they are needed.

If you need assistance or have questions about the Parchment transcript ordering service, please visit the Parchment Help Center website.

You may also request your official transcript free of charge by visiting the Registrar’s Office in Nelson 102 during business hours and providing a photo ID. If you would prefer not to use the online system and are unable to come to our office, you may also contact us at registrar@saumag.edu or 870-235-4031 and provide your mailing address and we will be happy to send you a paper request form by mail. There is no charge for this service, but you will be responsible for paying the return postage to mail the complete form back to our office for processing. Since a signature is required to authorize release of student records, transcript orders cannot be made via email or over the phone.

Unofficial Transcripts
Current students can access their unofficial transcript via their CampusConnect Student Dashboard under the “Registration” tab above the student information box.

If you no longer have access to CampusConnect, please complete the Unofficial Transcript Request form to request a digital (PDF) copy of your unofficial transcript. Unofficial transcripts can only be sent directly to the student by email. They cannot be mailed or sent to a third party.

Enrollment Verification
Current students can request an enrollment verification letter via their CampusConnect Student Dashboard under the “Forms” tab above the student information box. Enrollment verifications can be sent directly to the student or to a third party via email and/or physical mail.

If you no longer have access to CampusConnect, you can download a Letter of Good Standing Request and submit it via email to registrar@saumag.edu or bring the completed form in person to Nelson Hall 102.

Deferment Letter
If a letter of deferment for loan purposes is needed, students should send an email request to the Office of the Registrar at registrar@saumag.edu and a staff member will validate the required information and forward it to the National Student Loan Clearinghouse or individual loan provider.
