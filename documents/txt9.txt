About the Campaign
The Love and Loyalty Campaign is igniting opportunities and generating transformation all across the Southern Arkansas University Campus.  The boldest fundraising initiative in SAU’s 110-year history seeks to raise $22,275,000 over five years to impact the areas of student enrichment, faculty and staff, academic programs, student life, and community engagement, revitalized facilities, and athletics. 

Through this campaign, we hope to tell the story of SAU, engage our alumni, connect with our communities, nurture our friends, and secure the future for generations of students to come. 

Join with us in this transformative initiative – the Love and Loyalty Campaign.
